My project consists of a food delivery bot which may be used in places such as theatres, Stadiums, etc to deliver food effectively and quickly without causing much inconvenience to the general public in there.
The bot will be guided to the customers with dedicated maglev rails which will be laid on the sides of the staircases, all the way to the underneath of the chairs.
it it use the spaces under the chairs to deliver the product to the customer i.e. food and drinks.
it consists of a flat hard plastic tray enclosed by a box where main stock food items such as main course items will be put(eg burgers pastas).
the tray will be attachd to an extended arm which will extend forward and expose the compartment for cold drinks and pop corns underneath(unable to show movement in assembly). In this way it will effectively be able to deliver food drinks popcorn without much hassle.
The green box house will house two visible lights and a 360 dgeree camera to scan QR codes for detection of rows and columns for precise and fast delivery.
the hollow part inside the green box and the space remianing other than the drinks/popcorn section, will house electronics for bots operation.
the materials used will be mostly hard plastics except the mag-lev part which ofcourse consists of materials needed for magnetic levitation assembly.
AddInns/Improvements:One thing i would like to improve is to add a stabilizer for the food compartments so the food/drinks remain unaffected by the change in slope while the bot goes upstairs and the materials reach the customer without much disturbance.
